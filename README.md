# Automatic login with a Chrome extension
With this tutorial you can create a Chrome extension able to connect you automatically to a secure website.
In our example, we will sign in automatically to [GitHub](https://github.com/).
## 1-Setting
Download the [source code](https://github.com) available in my repository [Automatic-login-Chrome-extension](https://github.com). You don't have to change the files [contentscript.js](https://github.com) and [manifest.json](https://github.com). Open the file [script.js](https://github.com) and change only *your-username* and *your-password*. Your Chrome extension is ready to be installed.
## 2-Installing
Open Google Chrome. Go to chrome://extensions/(chrome://extensions/). Activate _developper mode_. Click on the button _Load unpackaged extension..._ and choose the _source code_ file that you modified at the first step. Your Chrome extension is ready to use. 
## 3-Enjoying
Now you can go to [GitHub Sign Up](https://github.com/login) and see the result. This Chrome extension is available at least for Google Chrome Version 63.
